<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0NhxthKUINQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> On Thursday, *20th Century Fox* revealed the first trailer for *The Predator*. Set in a small, suburban town, the trailer is highlighted by a young boy who finds a strange package. After opening the box, he discovers a "toy" that resembles an alien spaceship. By playing with the device, he accidentally triggers the Predator hunters back to Earth, which initiates a lethal battle with the human race. As the latest installment of the Predator franchise, Director, *Shane Black* captures this new film as a sequel to 1990's *Predator 2*. The explosive sci-fi is headlined by a cast of stars including *Sterling K. Brown,* *Olivia Munn*, B*oyd Holbrook*, *Thomas Jane*, and  *Keegan Michael-Key* (*Key and Peele*). Judging by this trailer, this should be one badass flick. The two-minute clip provides a glimpse of great CGI, an incredible cast, and amazing cinematography as a whole. We expect this film to be a creative masterpiece. Check out The Predator when it hits the box office on September 14th!

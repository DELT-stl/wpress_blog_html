Typical wedding invitations usually consist of ornate displays of pageantry: Intricate designs, elaborate patterns, fancy foils, frilly inserts, and all sorts of other bells and whistles that result in bulky, often ostentatious invitations. These, however, are not your typical wedding invitations. When creating invitations for his brother's wedding,  New Delhi graphic designer **[Shreyansh Gupta][1] **knew that traditional wedding invitations wouldn't truly embody the couple's spirit and personality. Gupta's brother is a passionate travel enthusiast who believes in the minimalistic way of life, free from fanfare and flourish. Consequently, Gupta decided to design something in stark contrast to the norm for these wedding invitations. Drawing inspiration from airline travel tickets, these unique designs utilize the style to evoke a fun and freeing feeling of an airline adventure. From the envelope style, to the barcodes, to the custom stamp designs, to the perforated ticket tear-off line, no detail has gone overlooked. Invitations to both the wedding and the reception were created alongside a wedding itinerary in both physical and digital formats. The clever use of color and design elements make these simple-yet-elegant designs almost indistinguishable from real airline tickets. Take a closer look at these innovative invitations on [Behance.][2]

### Shreyansh Gupta Bio:

*I’m a product designer by degree but a travel enthusiast by heart. Traveling makes me see the interesting potentials in the stream of design. Collecting miniatures fascinates me. Recycling & upgrading wastes into something more interesting satisfies me. Any graphic specimen in my daily life motivates me and has helped me develop an eye for the appealing surroundings. Creating compositions for photography helps me do justice to all the lovely things around. Transforming an empty or a drab wall into something distinctive and attractive excites me.  I’m basically a designer here to experience and learn from the possibilities the world has got to offer.*

<a href="http://brickvisual.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brick Visual</a> is a creative manufacture out of Budapest, Hungary.

They specialize in creating vivid and unique visualizations through Architecture, Digital Art, and Illustration.
<h2>Cinematography + architecture</h2>
Brick strives to "<span>put architecture on display in an atmosphere that best communicates the identity of the building and in a picturesque style that draws upon classical cinematography."</span>

A personal favorite Brick Visual project is their 3D concept of the <em>Hangzhou Tower</em>.

This visual is an incredible representation of China's new <em>Hangzhou Center</em>. Brick Visual provides a stunning, life-like view of Hangzho's remarkable architecture.

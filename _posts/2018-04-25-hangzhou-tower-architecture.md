<a href="http://brickvisual.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brick Visual</a> is a creative manufacture out of Budapest, Hungary. They specialize in creating vivid and unique visualizations through Architecture, Digital Art, and Illustration. 
## Cinematography + architecture Brick strives to "

<span>put architecture on display in an atmosphere that best communicates the identity of the building and in a picturesque style that draws upon classical cinematography."</span> A personal favorite Brick Visual project is their 3D concept of the *Hangzhou Tower*. This visual is an incredible representation of China's new *Hangzhou Center*. Brick Visual provides a stunning, life-like view of Hangzho's remarkable architecture. <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brick-Visual-Hangzhou-Tower.jpg" alt="Hangzhou Tower Archeticture" class="" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hangzhou-Tower-Brick-Visual.jpg" alt="Hangzhou Tower Architectural Design" class="" /> ![Architectural Design of Hangzhou Tower][1] <p style="text-align: center;">

<p style="text-align: left;">
  For over 20 years, Jack White has been a powerhouse in the music industry.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  One main reason for his longevity is his ability to reinvent himself through his branding.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  There is true value in creating a strong and consistent visual style for your brand, no matter the industry.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Jack White has never taken his public image lightly.
</p>

  <strong>The White Stripes: Creating An Image</strong>
</h2>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  White first found success with his Detroit-based garage-rock duo, <i>The White Stripes</i>, in 1997.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Fresh out of the gate, their brand was unmistakable.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  From the beginning, White knew that an iconic public image was an easy way to gain instant recognition and marketability.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The powerful use of red was weaved into every aspect of their image: album covers, posters, music videos, performance stages, outfits, etc.
</p>

  The color red became synonymous with the band due to their simple, yet eye-catching aesthetic.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  After painting the town red for over a decade as a part of The White Stripes, Jack White officially announced the band’s disbandment in 2009.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  White had already branched off into several side projects of his own.
</p>

  <strong>Third Man Records: Corporate Identity</strong>
</h2>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Jack White saw the necessity to expand his brand.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  He re-envisioned himself as more than just a musician.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Shifting his views from performer to producer (and his hue from red to yellow), White opened this first physical location for his production company, <a href="https://thirdmanrecords.com/"><i>Third Man Records</i></a>, in Nashville, Tennessee on March 13th, 2009.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Third Man Records draws its inspiration (in color and name) from White’s teenage one-man upholstery business, <i>Third Man Upholstery</i>.
</p>

  A simple change from red to yellow gave new life and freshness to Jack White’s personal brand, while still remaining true to his visually-striking single-color style.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  This new color scheme was integrated into Third Man Records from top to bottom: Bright yellow walls and floors in the store and production plant; A touring yellow record-store-on-wheels; Specialty yellow and black pressed vinyl records; Musical equipment and merchandise for his ever-growing number of devout fans. Yellow was the new red.
</p>

  <strong>Jack White III: Branding Yourself</strong>
</h2>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Three years after the full-scale launch of Third Man Records, Jack White sought to re-imagine his musical career once again, now as a solo artist.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  On April 24th, 2012, Jack White released his first self-produced solo album, <i>Blunderbuss</i>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  This release also coincided with his new solo branding campaign.
</p>

  Jack White’s rough and raw musicality was now juxtaposed against a sleek, dapper palette of blue tones.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  This new, blue brand once again reinvented Jack White’s public image parallel to the reinventing of his musical career.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Photoshoots; Public appearances; Music videos; Stage lighting: All of Jack White’s branding became bathed in brilliant blues.
</p>

  <strong>Many Shades of White</strong>
</h2>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  A man of many colors, Jack White has continually rebranded himself with every upward step in his career.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  All out of primary colors, it will be interesting to see what direction (and color) Jack White’s career takes in the years to come.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Jack White is currently on tour promoting his new album, <a href="http://jackwhiteiii.com/"><em>Boarding House Reach</em></a>, which was released back on March 23rd of this year.

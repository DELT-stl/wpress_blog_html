<a href="https://www.behance.net/pokedstudio">Jonathan Ball</a> is a very talented illustrator and digital artist from Cardiff, United Kingdom that specializes in creating flawless graphics and 3D imagery - primarily character designs.

In 2006, he founded <a href="http://www.pokedstudio.com/">PokedStudio</a> - a creative agency that provides international brands with characters, brands, packaging,Â logo illustrations, animations, adverts, display fonts, game concepts and storyboards.

Ball currently serves as the Company Director and Chief Illustrator, where he continues to contribute digital artwork and character designs that are truly one of a kind.

His portfolio is stacked with many impressive projects. It's no wonder why his work is regularly featured with brands like <em>MTV</em>, <em>Disney</em>, <em>Sony</em>, <em>Nickelodeon</em>, <em>Doritos</em>, and <em>Mattel</em>.

We'll let some of his creations speak for themselves.

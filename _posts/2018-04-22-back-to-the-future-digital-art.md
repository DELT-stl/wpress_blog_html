<a href="https://www.hernandezdreamphography.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Felix Hernandez</a>, a digital artist specializing in creative concepts involving <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/topics/design/digital-art/">digital art</a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/topics/photography/">photography</a>, is an extremely unique artist out of Cancun, Mexico.

What makes his work truly unique is his ability to create scenes on a miniature scale and photograph it in such a way it seems life-size.

One of our favorite projects by Felix is his concept art that features an awesome recreation of the famous Delorean from <em>Back to the Future</em>.

Felix recreated the Delorean on a miniature scale and - using a mixture of smoke, lighting, and fire - combined his digital artistry and photography expertise to create a surreal result.

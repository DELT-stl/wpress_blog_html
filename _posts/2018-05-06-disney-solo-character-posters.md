Disney recently launched their latest marketing campaign for the upcoming release of *Solo: A Star Wars Story. *With nine new character close-up posters in addition to a new main theatrical poster, these designs alongside the newest trailer provide us with our first real glimpse at the tone of the film. *Solo * marks Disney's first major re-casting of an iconic character in the Star Wars universe. Harrison Ford's iconic portrayal of Han Solo in four episodes of the *Star Wars Saga* (and one less-than-iconic portrayal in *The Star Wars Holiday Special*) leaves big shoes to fill for lead actor, *Alden Ehrenreich*. Fans are already skeptical of the film's success so Disney has their work cut out for them. Marketing this film to a generally-pessimistic fan base will be a challenging task. Disney plans to expand the Star Wars Universe similar to the *Marvel Cinematic Universe* and *Solo*<span> marks their first big departure into uncharted territory.</span> Hot off the heels of the controversial release of*Star Wars VII: The Last Jedi*, Disney is looking to lighten the mood with these new posters for *Solo. *<span>The bright oranges and sleek character illustrations evoke a sense of vibrancy and fun, unlike the darker, more serious tones set for the last two Star Wars films.</span> *Solo: A Star Wars Story* hits theaters everywhere on May 25th. <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Solo-MainPoster.jpg" alt="&quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story&quot; Theatrical Poster" class="aligncenter" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Han1.jpg" alt="&quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story&quot; - Han Solo Character Poster" class="aligncenter" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Qira1.jpg" alt="&quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story&quot; - Qi'ra Character Poster" class="aligncenter" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lando1.jpg" alt="&quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story&quot; - Lando Calrissean Character Poster" class="aligncenter" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chewie1.jpg" alt="&quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story&quot; - Chewbacca Character Poster" class="aligncenter" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Beckett1.jpg" alt="&quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story&quot; - Beckett Character Poster" class="aligncenter" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Val1.jpg" alt="&quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story&quot; - Val Character Poster" class="aligncenter" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Dryden.jpg" alt="&quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story&quot; - Dryden Character Poster" class="aligncenter" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Rio1.jpg" alt="&quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story&quot; - Rio Character Poster" class="aligncenter" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/L3-37.jpg" alt="&quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story&quot; - L3-37 Character Poster" class="aligncenter" />

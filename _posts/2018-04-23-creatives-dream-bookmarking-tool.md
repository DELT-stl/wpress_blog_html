To most, bookmarking has remained the same since they started using the web.

It is a simple featured added to every web browser - even the neanderthals over at IE headquarters managed to figure it out.

Keeping websites (or web pages) saved seems to be a relatively straightforward process - you bookmark the page into your folder and its saved forever.

For the first ten or so years that I used the internet, I never put any extra thought into how I save the websites I want to read later. Chrome's current bookmarking functionality was all I needed, but since I entered the creative industry, the outdated method slowly started to drive me crazy.

As I am sure most designers do, I have my bookmarks of design inspiration I occasionally reference when designing a website or needing some outside inspiration.

Now, I can always open my folder, click on a link, and view the website or design that way, but over time it started becoming a real pain in the ass. If I forgot the name of the website, I was forced to blindly click on each link until I found the one I needed.

For months, I searched for a solution that displayed my saved pages visually instead of textually, but couldn't seem to find an answer - until now.

<strong>In steps Raindrop.io.</strong>
<h2><strong>A visual way to view bookmarks</strong></h2>
<a href="https://raindrop.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raindrop.io</a> solved just about every issue I had when it came to bookmarking.

It provides different ways to sort your saved websites:
<ul>
 	<li>Lists</li>
 	<li>Headlines</li>
 	<li>Cards</li>
 	<li>Moodboard</li>
</ul>
<strong>Lists</strong>  and <strong>headlines</strong> sort your links very similarly to an average bookmarking tool: listed websites displaying the page or website title.

Alternatively, <strong>cards</strong> and <strong>moodboards </strong>show a websites open graph image.

You can also use moodboards and cards to save images (pictured above).

<strong>Some additional benefits of using Raindrop.io include:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Apps for both Mac and Windows</li>
 	<li>Mobile apps for IOS and Android</li>
 	<li>Browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera</li>
</ul>
You can use Raindrop.io for free, but they also have a "Pro plan" that costs just $3 per month and includes additional features like nested folders, broken link finder, cloud backup, and a few other components.

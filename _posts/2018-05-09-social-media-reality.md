The invention of social media can be looked at in two different ways: 
1.  One of the most innovative and important inventions of all time
2.  A cesspool of racism and people sharing their opinions no one gives a shit about There are five to six primary social platforms that serve a unique purpose for sharing our everyday lives. Each one has a unique, topical purpose, but they ultimately serve as a means to promote our self-worth and make our lives seem better than they are - holy shit that got dark. Nonetheless, plenty of value can be extracted from 

[social media][1] when it is used for things like business promotion, awareness, and connecting with both old and new friends. 
## Giving social media platforms a visual metaphor You only need to browse a social platform for ten minutes to determine the underlying goal users wish to accomplish. Opinions have been constructed about each platform, and CG artist 

[Ben Fearnley][2] decided to have some fun with these viewpoints. A little bit about Ben: 
> *"Ben Fearnley is an award-winning designer specializing in 3D illustration and typography. After spending some time working for a top design agencies in the UK, he is now based in NYC, working on a wide range of projects for global clients. With his strong eye for detail, Ben brings concepts to life for brands across the world.* *After working in various fields of design, his passion for creative image-making via CGI flourished and he decided to focus his craft within this realm, as he delights in creating almost anything imaginable and more.Clients Include: Adidas, Apple, BBC, Diageo, Google Android, MasterCard, Nike. Red Bull, Sony, Time Inc."* In other words, he is an extremely talented 3D artist. Ben has hilariously - yet meticulously - captured the reality of several social media platforms in amazingly unique ways. Below are some of the popular metaphors associated with a couple of the world's most popular social media platforms illustrated in Ben's [digital art][3]. <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/funny-facebook-art-metaphor.jpg" alt="Funny facebook art" class="" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/facebook-digital-art-interpretation.jpg" alt="Facebook digital art" class="" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/funny-twitter-digital-art.jpg" alt="Funny Twitter art" class="" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-reality-art.jpg" alt="Twitter Megaphone " class="" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/funny-snapchat-digital-art.jpg" alt="snapchat dick pic art" class="" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/snapchat-interpration-metaphor.jpg" alt="snapchat machine art" class="" />

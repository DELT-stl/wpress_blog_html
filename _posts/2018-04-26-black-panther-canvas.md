[Rukkit Kuanhawate][1] is a very popular graphic designer and Street Artist from Bangkok, Thailand. Known for his colorful and geometric designs, Kuanhawate's work can be found throughout Thailand, Korea, India, Hongkong, and Japan. In March, he created a unique portrait of a [black panther headshot][2]. Rukkit used an abandoned pink building as his canvas for this recent creation. Rukkit's art resembles a concept that is often shown in stainless glass designs. His graffiti displays several color variations, shapes, and a creative story depicted within the black panther base. This project is the latest testament that shows why Rukkit is one-of-a-kind. <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/89211862883217.5a9ed6712b883.jpg" alt="Black Panther Canvas" class="" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/acbabe62883217.5a9ed6712c4d2.jpg" alt="Black Panther Progress" class="" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/76e56562883217.5a9ed6712c8cc.jpg" alt="Black Panther Graffiti" class="" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ce7ea562883217.5a9ed6712e267.jpg" alt="Painting Black Panther" class="" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/88567a62883217.5a9ed6712a3c9.jpg" alt="Black Panther Closeup" class="" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/a0eb6762883217.5a9ed6712dc1e.jpg" alt="Black Panther Final Portrait" class="" />

We're not going to beat around the bush - Writing proposals sucks.

It is boring, tedious work that ultimately could lead to a bunch of time spent for no reason (if you don't get the job or contract)

For years, Microsoft Word and Powerpoint were the go-to tools for writing proposals. These tools did the trick for basic standard proposal documents that featured some text, headlines, and maybe some bullet points.

Then came Photoshop and InDesign.

These tools allowed you to expand your creativity and design a proposal that actually matched your brand's identity.

While these tools are still utilized by countless businesses and creative agencies, many have begun looking for a quicker solution to writing and sending proposals.
<h2>Finding the best proposal software for your business</h2>
Ultimately, your goal should be to create something that wins you and/or your company the job, but if you're like me, you hate sending anything to a current or potential client that looks like shit.

Being able to write up the terms of your proposal and feature it in a design you approve up is only hard enough - having the ability to do these things quickly is where things can get really difficult.
<h3>In the creative industry, everything you create reflects your business</h3>
Having to worry about creating a large number of proposals is obviously a good problem to have.

But if you spend too much time on one and fall behind on the others, missing your submission date could be a shitstorm waiting to happen.

In steps in the growing market of proposal software.

While the industry is still relatively small, it is likely to double in size over the next few years.

With that said, there are still plenty of quality proposal management tools available for your testing.

<hr />

<h3>What makes a good proposal software is unique to each industry and business</h3>
Some factors we took into account during our testing of these tools are things like:
<ul>
 	<li>Does it have a free trial?</li>
 	<li>What are the costs once the trial is finished?</li>
 	<li>How easy is it to use?</li>
 	<li>Does it have an user-friendly interface?</li>
 	<li>How much can we customize the proposal's design?</li>
 	<li>Does it feature tracking / analytics?</li>
 	<li>Can I send invoices and accept payments through as well?</li>
</ul>
While things like design options and UI design may not matter to most, I won't even test some tools if their software - or even website for that matter - look like shit.

For me, having a clean, user-friendly interface shows the software is being made by a modern company with the highest potential of making regular updates to their product.

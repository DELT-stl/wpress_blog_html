The Air Vapormax was released in March 2017 as Nike's latest innovation of the popular *Air Max* line. Through the years, Nike's Air Max collection has taken the world by storm, and the Air Vapormax continues to keep this tradition alive. The Vapormax is cushioned with Nike's trademark Air Max bubbles around the sole of the sneaker. *[Seriel Cut][1] *provides a great glimpse of the shoe in the ***KISS MY AIRS**[][2]* campaign, which features a collection of visuals, along with this really cool 6-second motion piece. https://vimeo.com/235167640 <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nike-air-max-motion-graphics.jpg" alt="Nike motion graphics case study" class="" /> <img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Air-Vapor-Max.jpg" alt="Nike Air Vapor Max" class="" /> Check out the rest of the motion graphics and art direction case study / campaign on [Behance][2].
